personalized_news_ranker
========================
The project aims to make an online personalized news aggregator. It will be of use to web-surfers who wish to obtain the

latest news stories from multiple websites at one place, personalized to their preferences.

The application will collect news stories from various sources, public news APIs, RSS feeds, etc (more details in

functional description), and categorize the stories into a topic hierarchy according to their content and subject of interest.

The application has facilities to record explicit user preferences at sign up time (it can also be modified later) which

will be leveraged to rank the incoming news stories according to their relevance to the logged in user. The highly relevant

news stories will be presented to the user in a web-interface.
