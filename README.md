Personalized News Ranker
========================
The project aims to make an online personalized news aggregator. It will be of use to web-surfers who wish to obtain the latest news stories from multiple websites at one place, personalized according their preferences, and browsing history.

The application will collect news stories from public news API called Feedzilla (feedzilla-api), and categorize the stories into a topic hierarchy according to their content and subject of interest. We used Freebase (www.freebase.com) for semantically categorizing the news fetched. The application has features to record explicit user preferences at sign up time (it can also be modified later) which will be leveraged to rank the incoming news stories according to their relevance to the logged-in user. The highly relevant news stories will be presented to the user in a web-interface. Relevance score for a news is calculated based on certain statistics, which fairly predicts the overall popularity of the news.
